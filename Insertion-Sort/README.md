1. Create a folder and download the files: AscendingNumbersGen, DescendingNumbersGen, RandomNumbersGen & InsertionSort_Vector.

2. Generate text files containing different sizes of ascending, descending and random numbers in an array, separately, by altering the value of 'n' in the provided python files and running in the terminal/cmd.

3. Compile the C++ code in the terminal using :: g++ InsertionSort_Vector.cpp

4. Use the command :: ./a.out < textfilename.txt [For Linux Terminal]
                       \t a,out < textfilename.txt [For Windows CMD]

5. Time Taken for the execution of the code will be displayed once Step 4 is executed.


Record the time taken along with the input size, to plot a graph of time versus input size for Insertion Sort.

SampleGraphs contains sample graphs for sample inputs taken.
